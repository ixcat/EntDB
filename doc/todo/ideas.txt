Future Directions
-----------------

- /etc/hosts handling

  More code, aux tables required.

  Not strictly required for base NIS functionality.

  However, as a bonus collects info for potential DNS / named integration -
  similarly parsing of ethers files would allow DHCP generation, etc.
  if not, could at least generate localhost/localhost6 and nis server hosts
  entries for client /etc/hosts configuration.

- makedbm capability?

  - could simplify much parsing code if loaddbm / dumpdbm compatibility 
    layer implemented..

    although, on 'loadbm' side, would lose granularity of record values, 
    1:M relationships in SQL. Would be useful for direct & simple k/v 
    lookups for arbitrary tables

- filesystem quota support

  implement filesystem quota support in database to allow 
  setting/updating/queriying of user quotas.
