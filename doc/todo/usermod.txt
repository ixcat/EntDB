User-managed account configuration notes -

Linux-style script is not portable:

  - linux rpc.yppasswdd subcommand protocol is linux specific,
    tangentially relies on DES crypt() checking as well (which is
    also not common to e.g. OpenBSD, which has removed it.

  - Other libre systems only implement 'alternate password dir'
    rather than script at best in their rpc.yppasswdd implying no
    simple way to update the backend database without bidirectional
    sync (db->files for new users vs files->db for user updates)

Therefore, 

Need a script to change passwords interactively & will set as login
shell for all users on nis server box - to change, ssh to NIS box.

Ideally, this would be limited and spawn a subprogram / copy of
itself via e.g. sudo with cleanly sanitized input to do the actual
changing rather than giving user priveledged process direct access
to user input.

Platform Notes:

  - Linux notes:

    -E program 

     sets env YP_PASSWD_OLD, YP_PASSWD_NEW, YP_USER, 
              YP_GECOS,  YP_SHELL

    -x program 

      stdin/stdout / pipe style protocol
 
  - OpenBSD:       

    - zapped rpc.yppasswdd - has login_lchpass class helper gizmo
      (e.g. ssh to nis server, run this)

  - NetBSD:
    - only '-d' option for alternate directory

  - FreeBSD:

    - many featuers: multidomain, alternate dir. but no external 
      script option
