PASSWD(5)							     PASSWD(5)

NAME
       passwd -	password file

DESCRIPTION
       Passwd contains for each	user the following information:

       name (login name, contains no upper case)
       encrypted password
       numerical user ID
       numerical group ID
       GCOS job	number,	box number, optional GCOS user-id
       initial working directory
       program to use as Shell

       This  is	 an  ASCII file.  Each field within each user's	entry is sepa-
       rated from the next by a	colon.	The GCOS field is used only when  com-
       municating with that system, and	in other installations can contain any
       desired information.  Each user is separated from the next  by  a  new-
       line.   If  the password	field is null, no password is demanded;	if the
       Shell field is null, the	Shell itself is	used.

       This file resides in directory /etc.  Because of	 the  encrypted	 pass-
       words,  it  can	and does have general read permission and can be used,
       for example, to map numerical user ID's to names.
