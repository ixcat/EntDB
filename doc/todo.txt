TODO
----

- shell command loop functionality
- Set correct changedate in User:::EntDB::Command::SetPassword
  - dependant on proper aux data storage for all platforms since no 
    db record is available.
  - sidenote: math for linux shadow (epoch days):
      my $now = int ( time/86400 );
- Password expiration interpretation support in dump routines
  e.g. set /sbin/nologin, invalid hash, or similar in appropriate files
  depending on expiry settings in DB
- gecos interpolation into generated password files
- chsh login shell functionality for xplat password changing
- Internal OO code cleanup (see todo/oocleanup.txt) to support better object
  subclassing for client-code extensibility.
- misc future ideas (see todo/ideas.txt)
