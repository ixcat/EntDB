TODO
----

- Patched Linux NIS Makefile pointing to /var/yp/ent files
- Patched OpenBSD NIS Makefile pointing to /var/yp/ent files
- entdb shell functionality
- default db path functionality? (or perhaps simply env?)
- Set correct changedate in bin/dbpasswd
  fixme: requires expiry storage, and expiry data availability 
    varies by platform.. 
    sidenote: math for linux shadow (epoch days):
      my $now = int ( time/86400 );
- Password expiration interpretation support in dump routines
  e.g. set /sbin/nologin, invalid hash, or similar in appropriate files
  depending on expiry settings in DB
- gecos interpolation into generated password files
- chsh login shell for xplat password changing
- Internal OO code cleanup (see todo/oocleanup.txt) to support better object
  subclassing for client-code extensibility.
- misc future ideas (see todo/ideas.txt)
