-- Of note - this only reports auxiliary group membership -

--
-- XXX: This query is a bit odd/iffy..
--    Without the rowid selection, aux_groups are displayed in reverse
--    with respect to their insert sequence, yielding a reversal when
--    groups are read back, causing dumps to mismatch w/r/t loads,
--    which is undesired for the basic 1:1 load/dump idea of functionality.
--    for some strange reason, simply adding the rowid select fixes this.
--    needless to say this could be a bit undefined and potentially
--    better done in some other way..

__DATA__
Notes concerning schema implementation
======================================

common unix function behavior on flatfiles
------------------------------------------

The entdb utility and database schema should attempt to preserve
most traditional unix semantics where possible.

The following key functions and their behavior are documented here
as a reference:

  getpwent - iterate sequentially over records in pwent
  getpwnam - get 1st for name string
  getpwuid - get 1st for uid .. hmm nismaps? 
    ... (built by getpwent? keyed sequentially?)

  getgrent - sequential reading
  getgrnam - sequential search for name
  getgruid - sequential search for uid

it should be noted that entdb databases built from NIS or other
directory-based services might result in differing record storage
than the above behavior would suggest with respect to the input
source files used to create the database -

For example, if using entdb to distill existing NIS entries:

  1) NIS Input files are stored in expected order
  2) NIS Maps are built using normal non-entdb procedures, 
     resulting in different data sequence in above system calls due to
     database indexing methods in the data storage for the map
  3) These differing sequences are stored into the resuling entdb.

As the above illustrates, the unexpected sequence of results in the
generated entdb database is not a bug in entdb itself but instead
simply a reflection of the upstream source; If original input
sequences are desired, the input data should be configured into the
traditional flat-file locations on the system used to build the
entdb database and then re-run.

Primary vs Auxiliary Groups
---------------------------

From 4.3BSD su(1):

  If no userid is specified, ``root'' is assumed.  Only users in the
  ``wheel'' group (group 0) can su to ``root'', even with the root
  password.  To remind the super-user of his responsibilities, the Shell
  substitutes `#' for its usual prompt.

with bin/su.c using getgrgid(3) calls to ascertain gid 0 if such calls
are successful.

OpenBSD (2.4ish) updates the page to read:

  If group 0 (normally ``wheel'') has users listed then only those users
  can su to ``root''.  It is not sufficient to change a user's /etc/passwd
  entry to add them to the ``wheel'' group; they must explicitly be listed
  in /etc/group.  If no one is in the ``wheel'' group, it is ignored, and
  anyone who knows the root password is permitted to su to ``root''.

Which documents the code behavior previously extant in 4.3BSD su(1).

Therefore, 
given the historical importance of the 4.3BSD release, and the
early and appearance of 4.3BSD's su(1) behavior consistent up
to the present day, and the importance of the su(1) utility to
system operation, the differentiation of primary vs auxiliary
groups is and has been an important facet of UNIX system operation
which should be adhered to in this database model.

Todo: track down and document duplicate uid/gid behavior history - notes:

  - OpenBSD 5.8 (modern reference):
    - getgrent(3) ob58 states:
      Identical group names or group GIDs may result in undefined behavior.
    - no similar message in getpwent
  - Couldn't find origin of 'toor' account as configured in freebsd -
    ( no 4.2/4.3BSD /etc/passwd available at time of writing to cross-check )
